{"name":"Donte's Assessments","tagline":"Projects","body":"### Welcome Message\r\n![](http://playeressence.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/attack-on-titan-anime-banner-eren-600x360.jpg)\r\n\r\nMy name is Donte' Wilson and I've always dreamed of becoming apart of the gaming industry. I am currently attending AIE(Academy of Interactive Entertainment), there I hope to develop a greater understanding of game programming. Throughout my life I have played multiple games and I have observed how they work mechanically. This site will display the assessments I have completed and some of the work I have accomplished here at AIE.\r\n### Assessments\r\nAll assessments that I have completed will be displayed on this site and available for download. I am currently in the process of editing my repository so it displays my information in an organized manner. There will be an easy and simple process of viewing my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDonte Wilson - Owner of Site.\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\nIf you have questions about my work or progress, Contact me at donte.wilson@students.aie.edu.au\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
